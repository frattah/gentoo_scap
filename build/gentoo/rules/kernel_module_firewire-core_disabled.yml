    To configure the system to prevent the <code>firewire-core</code>

    kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to the file <code>/etc/modprobe.d/firewire-core.conf</code>:

    If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the <code>firewire-core</code>
    kernel module,

    it will contain lines inside any file in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> or the deprecated<code>
    /etc/modprobe.conf</code>.

    These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as
    <code>/bin/true</code>) upon a module <code>install</code> event.


    Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code>
    and the deprecated <code>/etc/modprobe.conf</code>:

    <pre>$ grep -r firewire-core /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d</pre>'
