description: The systemd_timesyncd service should not be installed.
rationale: 'Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events

    and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct

    time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when

    conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.

    Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift)

    may be inaccurate.
