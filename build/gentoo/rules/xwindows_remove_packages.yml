description: 'By removing the following packages,  the system no longer has X Windows
    installed.


    <tt>xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-server-Xwayland</tt>


    If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical user
    mode.

    This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a
    <tt>graphical.target</tt>

    mode. To do so, run the following command:


    <pre>sudo yum remove xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common xorg-x11-server-utils
    xorg-x11-server-Xwayland</pre>'
rationale: 'Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system. X windows has a long history of security

    vulnerabilities and should not be installed unless approved and documented.'

-   functionality: 'The installation and use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) increases
        your attack vector and decreases your

        overall security posture. Removing the package xorg-x11-server-common package
        will remove the graphical target
