description: 'Tables in nftables hold chains. Each table only has one address family
    and only applies

    to packets of this family. Tables can have one of six families.'
rationale: 'Nftables doesn''t have any default tables. Without a table being built,
    nftables will not

    filter network traffic.'

ocil: "To verify that a nftables table exists, run the following command:\n<pre>$
    sudo nft list tables</pre>\nOutput should include a list of nftables similar to:\n<tt>\n

warnings:
-   general: Adding or editing rules in a running nftables can cause loss of connectivity
        to the system.
-   general: 'Both the SCE check and remediation for this rule only consider runtime
        settings.

        There is no specific file to check as it depends on each site''s policy. Therefore,
        check

        and remediation use the nft command directly. The fix is not persistent across
        system

        reboots.'
-   functionality: 'SCE check does not support variables, therefore the SCE check
        in this rule only checks the

        address family, regardless of the table name.'
