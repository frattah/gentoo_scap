description: 'Verify the /run/log/journal and /var/log/journal directories are group-owned
    by

    "systemd-journal" by using the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo find /run/log/journal /var/log/journal  -type d -exec stat -c "%n %G" {}
    \;

    </pre>

    If any output returned is not owned by "systemd-journal", this is a finding.'
rationale: 'Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of
    the errors.

    Error messages are an indicator of an organization''s operational state or can
    identify

    the operating system or platform. Additionally, personally identifiable information

    (PII) and operational information must not be revealed through error messages
    to

    unauthorized personnel or their designated representatives.'
