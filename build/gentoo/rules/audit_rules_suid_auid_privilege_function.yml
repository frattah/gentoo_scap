description: 'Verify the system generates an audit record when actions are run as
    another user.

    sudo provides users with temporary elevated privileges to perform operations,
    either as the superuser or another user.


    If audit is using the "auditctl" tool to load the rules, run the following command:


    <pre>$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>


    If audit is using the "augenrules" tool to load the rules, run the following command:


    <pre>$ sudo grep -r execve /etc/audit/rules.d</pre>

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64  S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>


    If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules for "SUID" files are not defined, this
    is a finding.'
rationale: 'Creating an audit log of users with temporary elevated privileges and
    the

    operation(s) they performed is essential to reporting. Administrators will

    want to correlate the events written to the audit trail with the records

    written to sudo''s logfile to verify if unauthorized commands have

    been executed.

    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by

    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have

    compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern

    and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use

    of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the

    risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.'
