description: 'FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a traditional and widely used standard
    tool for

    transferring files between a server and clients over a network, especially where
    no

    authentication is necessary (permits anonymous users to connect to a server).

    <br/>

    The <code>ftp</code> package can be removed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum erase ftp</pre>'
rationale: 'FTP does not protect the confidentiality of data or authentication credentials.
    It

    is recommended SFTP be used if file transfer is required. Unless there is a need

    to run the system as a FTP server (for example, to allow anonymous downloads),
    it is

    recommended that the package be removed to reduce the potential attack surface.'
