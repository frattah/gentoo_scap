description: 'Configure the root account to enforce a <sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_root"
    />-day maximum password lifetime restriction by running the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo chage -M <sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_root" /> root</pre>'
rationale: 'Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore,

    passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does

    not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their

    passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be

    compromised.'
