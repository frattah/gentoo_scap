description: ' To properly set the owner of <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, run the command:

rationale: 'The ownership of the /etc/sysctl.d directory by the root user is important

    because this directory hosts kernel configuration. Protection of this

    directory is critical for system security. Assigning the ownership to root

    ensures exclusive control of the kernel configuration.'
