    The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.

    However, if it can be disabled, do so.

    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated

    remote access.'

ocil: 'To check that the <code>sshd</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>sshd</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>sshd</code> service has either not been installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>sshd</code><br/> disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>sshd</code> is not active (i.e. not
    running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active sshd</pre>


    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>sshd</code> is masked,
    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>sshd</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'
