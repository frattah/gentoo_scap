description: 'By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> will reboot the system if the

    <tt>Ctrl-Alt-Del</tt> key sequence is pressed.

    <br /><br />

    To configure the system to ignore the <tt>Ctrl-Alt-Del</tt> key sequence

    from the Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of rebooting the system,

    add or set <tt>logout</tt> to <tt>['''']</tt> in

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

    <pre>[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]

    logout=['''']</pre>

    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to

    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent

    user modification. For example:

    <pre>/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/logout</pre>

    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'
rationale: 'A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,

    can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in

    the case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term

    loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.'
