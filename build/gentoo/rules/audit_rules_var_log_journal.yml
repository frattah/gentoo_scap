description: 'Auditing the systemd journal files provides logging that can be used
    for

    forensic purposes. Verify the system generates audit records for all events

    that affect "/var/log/journal" by using the following command:


    <pre>

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep journal

    -w /var/log/journal/ -p wa -k systemd_journal

    </pre>


    If the command does not return a line that matches the example or the line

    is commented out, this is a finding.


    Note: The "-k" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example

    output above.'
rationale: 'Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker often attempts

    to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish

    this is for the attacker to modify system level binaries and their operation.

    Auditing the systemd journal files provides logging that can be used for

    forensic purposes.'
