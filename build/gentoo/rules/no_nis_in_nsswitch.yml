description: 'Each call to a function which retrieves data from a system database
    like the

    password or group database is handled by the Name Service Switch

    implementation in the GNU C library.  The various services provided are

    implemented by independent modules, each of which naturally varies widely

    from the other. One of such modules is the <tt>nis</tt> module, which allows

    to get information from NIS servers.'
rationale: NIS service is insecure and should not be used.

    If a line is returned and it contains the word <tt>nis</tt> in the list

    of services, it is a finding.'
