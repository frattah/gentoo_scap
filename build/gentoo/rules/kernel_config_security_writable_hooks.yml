description: "Ensure kernel structures associated with LSMs are always mapped as read-only
    after system boot.\n\nThe configuration that was used to build kernel is available
    at <tt>/boot/config-*</tt>.\n    To check the configuration value for <tt>CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS</tt>,
    run the following command:\n    <tt>grep CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS /boot/config-*</tt>\n
    \   \n    Configs with value 'n' are not explicitly set in the file, so either
    commented lines or no\n    lines should be returned.\n    "
rationale: 'If CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS is enabled, then hooks can be loaded
    at runtime and

    being able to manipulate hooks is a way to bypass all LSMs.'

-   general: There is no remediation for this besides re-compiling the kernel with
