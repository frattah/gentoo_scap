description: "<tt>systemd-timesyncd</tt> is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing
    the system clock\nacross the network. The <tt>systemd-timesyncd</tt> daemon implements:\n
    \ - Implements an SNTP client\n  - Runs with minimal privileges\n  - Saves the
    current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired\n  - Is hooked
    up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available\nAdd or
    edit server or pool lines to <tt>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</tt> as appropriate:\n<pre>server
    &lt;remote-server&gt;</pre>\nMultiple servers may be configured."
rationale: Configuring <tt>systemd-timesyncd</tt> ensures time synchronization is
    working properly.
