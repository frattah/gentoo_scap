description: 'nftables provides a new in-kernel packet classification framework that
    is based on a

    network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and a new nft userspace command line tool.

    nftables reuses the existing Netfilter subsystems such as the existing hook infrastructure,

    the connection tracking system, NAT, userspace queuing and logging subsystem.

    The <code>nftables</code> package can be installed with the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum install nftables</pre>'
rationale: '<tt>nftables</tt> is a subsystem of the Linux kernel that can protect
    against threats

    originating from within a corporate network to include malicious mobile code and
    poorly

    configured software on a host.'
