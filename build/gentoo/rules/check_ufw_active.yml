description: 'Verify the ufw is enabled on the system with the following command:

    <pre># sudo ufw status</pre>

    If the above command returns the status as "inactive" or any type of error, this
    is a finding.'
rationale: "Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network
    devices and information systems, \nwhich lack automated control capabilities,
    increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.  \nRemote
    access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or
    an information system) communicating \nthrough an external, nonorganization-controlled
    network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
    \ \nUbuntu 22.04 LTS functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement
    action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity. \nAutomated control of remote
    access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote
    access policies by \nenforcing connection rules of remote access applications
    on a variety of information system components."
