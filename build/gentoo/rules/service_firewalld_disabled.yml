description: "Firewalld (Dynamic Firewall Manager) provides a dynamically managed
    firewall with\nsupport for network/firewall \u201Czones\u201D to assign a level
    of trust to a network and its\nassociated connections, interfaces or sources.
    It has support for IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet\nbridges and also for IPSet firewall settings.
    There is a separation of the runtime and\npermanent configuration options.\n\nThe
    <code>firewalld</code> service can be disabled with the following command:\n<pre>$
    sudo systemctl mask --now firewalld.service</pre>"
rationale: "Running Firewalld along other service with the same functionality may
    lead to conflict \nand unexpected results."

ocil: 'To check that the <code>firewalld</code> service is disabled in system boot
    configuration,

    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>firewalld</code></pre>

    Output should indicate the <code>firewalld</code> service has either not been
    installed,

    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <code>firewalld</code><br/> disabled</pre>


    Run the following command to verify <code>firewalld</code> is not active (i.e.
    not running) through current runtime configuration:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl is-active firewalld</pre>


    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:

    <pre>inactive</pre>


    The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>firewalld</code> is masked,
    run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo systemctl show <code>firewalld</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>


    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:


    <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>


    <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'
