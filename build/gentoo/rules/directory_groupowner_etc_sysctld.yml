description: ' To properly set the group owner of <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, run

rationale: 'The ownership of the /etc/sysctl.d directory by the root group is important

    because this directory hosts kernel configuration. Protection of this

    directory is critical for system security. Assigning the ownership to root

    ensures exclusive control of the kernel configuration.'
