description: 'If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the

    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the

    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the

    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-w /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts -p wa -k audit_rules_networkconfig_modification_network_scripts</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to

    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

    <pre>-w /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts -p wa -k audit_rules_networkconfig_modification_network_scripts</pre>'
rationale: 'The network environment should not be modified by anything other

    than administrator action. Any change to network parameters should be

    audited.'
