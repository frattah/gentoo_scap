description: 'The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory used

    for temporary file storage. This directory is managed by <tt>systemd-tmpfiles</tt>.

    Ensure that the <tt>tmp.mount</tt> systemd unit is enabled.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is used as temporary storage by many programs.

    Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in a tmpfs filesystem enables the setting of more

    restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.

    The <tt>tmp.mount</tt> unit configures the tmpfs filesystem and ensures

    the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is wiped during reboot.'
