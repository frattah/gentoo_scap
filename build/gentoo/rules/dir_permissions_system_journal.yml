description: 'Verify the /run/log/journal and /var/log/journal directories have

    permissions set to "2750" or less permissive by using the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo find /run/log/journal /var/log/journal  -type d -exec stat -c "%n %a" {}
    \;

    </pre>

    If any output returned has a permission set greater than "2750", this is a finding.'
rationale: 'Any operating system providing too much information in error messages
    risks

    compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error messages

    needs to be carefully considered by the organization.'
