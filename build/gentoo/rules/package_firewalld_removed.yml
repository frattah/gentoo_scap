description: "firewalld (Dynamic Firewall Manager) provides a dynamically managed
    firewall with\nsupport for network/firewall \u201Czones\u201D to assign a level
    of trust to a network and its\nassociated connections, interfaces or sources.
    It has support for IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet\nbridges and also for IPSet firewall settings.
    There is a separation of the runtime and\npermanent configuration options.\nThe
    <code>firewalld</code> package can be removed with the following command:\n<pre>\n$
    sudo yum erase firewalld</pre>"
rationale: 'Running both <b>nftables.service</b> and <b>firewalld.service</b> may
    lead to conflict and
