description: 'Verify that Meltdown mitigations are not disabled:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep mitigations</pre>


    The mitigations must not be set to "off".'
rationale: 'Hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to steal data that is currently
    processed on the

    computer. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs,
    a

    malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to obtain secrets stored in
    the memory of

    other running programs. This might include passwords stored in a password manager
    or browser;

    personal photos, emails, and instant messages; and business-critical documents.'
