description: 'Verify that the "journalctl" command is owned by "root" by

    using the following command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo find /usr/bin/journalctl -exec stat -c "%n %U" {} \;

    </pre>

    If any output returned is not owned by "root", this is a finding.'
rationale: 'Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of
    the errors.

    Error messages are an indicator of an organization''s operational state or can

    identify the operating system or platform. Additionally, personally identifiable

    information (PII) and operational information must not be revealed through error

    messages to unauthorized personnel or their designated representatives.'
