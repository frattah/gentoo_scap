description: 'The SELinux state should be set to <tt>enforcing</tt> or <tt>permissive</tt>
    at system boot

    time. In the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>, add or correct the following line
    to configure

    the system to boot into enforcing or permissive mode:

    <pre>SELINUX=enforcing</pre>

    OR

    <pre>SELINUX=permissive</pre>'
rationale: 'Running SELinux in disabled mode is strongly discouraged. It prevents
    enforcing the SELinux

    controls without a system reboot. It also avoids labeling any persistent objects
    such as

    files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future.'

-   general: 'In case the SELinux is "disabled", the automated remediation will adopt
        a more

        conservative approach and set it to "permissive" in order to avoid any system
        disruption

        and give the administrator the opportunity to assess the impact and necessary
        efforts

        before setting it to "enforcing", which is strongly recommended.'
