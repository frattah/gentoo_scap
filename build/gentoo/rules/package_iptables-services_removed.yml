description: 'The <code>iptables-services</code> package can be removed with the following
    command:

    <pre>

    $ sudo yum erase iptables-services</pre>'
rationale: '<tt>iptables-services</tt> provides the services iptables and ip6tables
    that have been split

    out of the base package since they are not active by default anymore. These services
    load the

    iptables rules during the system startup and also allow one to reload the iptables
    rules

    during runtime. Those iptables services conflicts with firewalld so they should
    be removed if

    firewalld is used.'
