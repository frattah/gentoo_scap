description: 'Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets
    reaching the end of

    the chain. There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is
    set to accept,

    the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the
    packet will

    continue traversing the network stack.'
rationale: 'It is easier to allow acceptable usage than to block unacceptable usage.
