description: Firewalld can be configured with many backends, such as nftables.
rationale: 'Nftables is modern kernel module for controling network connections coming
    into a system.

    Utilizing the limit statement in "nftables" can help to mitigate DoS attacks.'

        vuln_discussion: 'DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for
            legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish
            its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.


            This requirement addresses the configuration of Gentoo to mitigate the
            impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability.
            For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and
            solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exists
            to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g.,
            limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased
            capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the
            susceptibility to some DoS attacks.'
