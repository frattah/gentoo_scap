description: 'Configure <tt>firewalld</tt> to restrict loopback traffic to the <tt>lo</tt>
    interface.


    The loopback traffic must be trusted by assigning the <tt>lo</tt> interface to
    the

    <tt>firewalld</tt> <tt>trusted</tt> zone. However, the loopback traffic must be
    restricted

    to the loopback interface as an anti-spoofing measure.


    To configure <tt>firewalld</tt> to restrict loopback traffic to the <tt>lo</tt>
    interface,

    run the following commands:

    <pre>

    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-rich-rule=''rule family=ipv4
    source address="127.0.0.1" destination not address="127.0.0.1" drop''

    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-rich-rule=''rule family=ipv6
    source address="::1" destination not address="::1" drop''

    </pre>


    To ensure <tt>firewalld</tt> settings are applied in runtime, run the following
    command:

    <pre>firewall-cmd --reload</pre>'
rationale: 'Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically
    critical to

    operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback
    network

    traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network
    as an

    anti-spoofing measure.'
