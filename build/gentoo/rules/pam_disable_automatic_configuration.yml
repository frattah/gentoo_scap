description: 'Verify the SUSE operating system is configured to not overwrite Pluggable

    Authentication Modules (PAM) configuration on package changes.'
rationale: '<tt>pam-config</tt> is a command line utility that automatically generates

    a system PAM configuration as packages are installed, updated or removed

    from the system. <tt>pam-config</tt> removes configurations for PAM modules

    and parameters that it does not know about. It may render ineffective PAM

    configuration by the system administrator and thus impact system security.'
