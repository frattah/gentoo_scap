description: 'Tables in nftables hold chains. Each table only has one address family
    and only applies

    to packets of this family. Tables can have one of six families.

    Chains are containers for rules. They exist in two kinds, base chains and regular
    chains.

    A base chain is an entry point for packets from the networking stack, a regular
    chain may

    be used as jump target and is used for better rule organization.'
rationale: 'If a base chain doesn''t exist with a hook for input, forward, and delete,
    packets that would

    flow through those chains will not be touched by nftables.'

ocil: "To verify that base chains exist for INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT, run the following
    commands:\n<pre>$ sudo nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input'</pre>\n<pre>$ sudo
    nft list ruleset | grep 'hook forward'</pre>\n<pre>$ sudo nft list ruleset | grep
    'hook output'</pre>\nOutput should be similar to:\n<tt>\n  type filter hook input
    priority 0;\n  type filter hook forward priority 0;\n  type filter hook output
    priority 0;\n</tt>"

-   general: Configuring rules over ssh, by creating a base chain with policy drop
        will cause loss of connectivity. Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been
        added to the base chain prior to setting the base cahin's policy to drop
