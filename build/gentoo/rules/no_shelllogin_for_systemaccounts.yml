description: 'Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and
    exist to perform some

    administrative functions. Should an attacker be able to log into these accounts,
    they should

    not be granted access to a shell.

    <br/><br/>

    The login shell for each local account is stored in the last field of each line
    in

    <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. System accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less
    than

    <tt>1000</tt>. The user ID is stored in the third field. If any system account

    other than <tt>root</tt> has a login shell, disable it with the command:

    <pre>$ sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin <i>account</i></pre>'
rationale: 'Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
    difficult for

    attackers to make use of system accounts.'
