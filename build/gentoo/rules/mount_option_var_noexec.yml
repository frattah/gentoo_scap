description: 'The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries from
    being

    executed out of <tt>/var</tt>.

    Add the <code>noexec</code> option to the fourth column of

    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

    <code>/var</code>.'
rationale: 'The <tt>/var</tt> directory contains variable system data such as logs,

    mails and caches. No binaries should be executed from this directory.'
