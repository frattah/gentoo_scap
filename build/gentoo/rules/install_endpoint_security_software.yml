description: "Verify that an Endpoint Security Solution has been deployed on the operating
    system.  \nIf there is not an Endpoint Security Solution deployed, this is a finding."
rationale: 'Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on
    a continuous

    and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain

    vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.


    To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution

    incorporating continuous scanning and periodic scanning using other tools,

    as specified in the requirement.'
