description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding</code>
    kernel parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=0</pre>

    To make sure that the setting is persistent, add the following line to a file

rationale: 'IP forwarding permits the kernel to forward packets from one network

    interface to another. The ability to forward packets between two networks is

    only appropriate for systems acting as routers.'

        vuln_discussion: Routing protocol daemons are typically used on routers to
            exchange network topology information with other routers. If this capability
            is used when not required, system network information may be unnecessarily
            transmitted across the network.
