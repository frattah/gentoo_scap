description: "chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
    It is designed to\nsynchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use
    a source that is highly\naccurate. More information on chrony can be found at\n\n
    \   <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='https://chrony-project.org/'>https://chrony-project.org/</a>.\nChrony
    can be configured to be a client and/or a server.\nTo ensure that chronyd is running
    under chrony user account,\nadd or edit the\n<tt>OPTIONS</tt> variable in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/chronyd</tt>
    to include <tt>-u chrony</tt>:\n<pre>OPTIONS=\"-u chrony\"</pre>\n\nThis recommendation
    only applies if chrony is in use on the system."
rationale: 'If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring
    time synchronization

    is working properly.'
