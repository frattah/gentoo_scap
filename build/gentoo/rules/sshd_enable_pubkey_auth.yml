description: 'Enable SSH login with public keys.

    <br/>

    The default SSH configuration enables authentication based on public keys. The
    appropriate

    configuration is used if no value is set for <tt>PubkeyAuthentication</tt>.

    <br/>

    To explicitly enable Public Key Authentication, add or correct the following



    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:


    <pre>PubkeyAuthentication yes</pre>'
rationale: "Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to\nprivileged
    functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication\nrequires using two
    or more factors to achieve authentication.\nA privileged account is defined as
    an information system account with\nauthorizations of a privileged user. \nThe
    DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor\nauthentication."
