description: 'If any files are not owned by a user, then the cause of their lack of
    ownership should be

    investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an appropriate
    user.


    Locate the mount points related to local devices by the following command:

    <pre>$ findmnt -n -l -k -it $(awk ''/nodev/ { print $2 }'' /proc/filesystems |
    paste -sd,)</pre>


    For all mount points listed by the previous command, it is necessary to search
    for files which

    do not belong to a valid user using the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo find <i>MOUNTPOINT</i> -xdev -nouser 2&gt;/dev/null</pre>'
rationale: 'Unowned files do not directly imply a security problem, but they are generally
    a sign that

    something is amiss. They may be caused by an intruder, by incorrect software installation
    or

    draft software removal, or by failure to remove all files belonging to a deleted
    account, or

    other similar cases. The files should be repaired so they will not cause problems
    when

    accounts are created in the future, and the cause should be discovered and addressed.'
