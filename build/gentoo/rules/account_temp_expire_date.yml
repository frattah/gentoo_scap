description: 'Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation

    procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts. In the event

    temporary accounts are required, configure the system to

    terminate them after a documented time period. For every temporary account, run
    the following command to set an expiration date on

    it, substituting <tt><i>USER</i></tt> and <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt>

    appropriately:

    <pre>$ sudo chage -E <i>YYYY-MM-DD USER</i></pre>

    <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt> indicates the documented expiration date for the

    account. For U.S. Government systems, the operating system must be

    configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a

    period of 72 hours.'
rationale: 'If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for

    an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access.

    To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts

    must be set upon account creation.

            that are established during pressing circumstances, such as new software
            or hardware configuration or an incident response, where the need for
            prompt account activation requires bypassing normal account authorization
            procedures. If any inactive temporary accounts are left enabled on the
            system and are not either manually removed or automatically expired within
            72 hours, the security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed
            to exploitation by unauthorized users or insider threat actors.


            Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts,
            also known as "last resort" or "break glass" accounts, are local logon
            accounts enabled on the system for emergency use by authorized system
            administrators to manage a system when standard logon methods are failing
            or not available. Emergency accounts are not subject to manual removal
            or scheduled expiration requirements.


            The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed
            by the circumstances but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented
            permanent account should be established for privileged users who need
            long-term maintenance accounts.'
