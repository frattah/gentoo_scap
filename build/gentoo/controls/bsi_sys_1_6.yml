    title: Planning Container Use
    description: Before containers are deployed, the goal of such a deployment (e.g.
        scaling, availability, disposable containers for safety or CI/CD) SHOULD be
        determined so that all the security- related aspects of installation, operation,
        and decommissioning can be planned. The planning SHOULD also take into account
        the operational overhead resulting from container deployment or mixed operation.
        The planning MUST be adequately documented

    description: The management of containers MUST ONLY be carried out in line with
        appropriate planning. This planning MUST cover the entire lifecycle from commissioning
        to decommissioning, including operation and updates. When planning container
        management, it MUST be taken into account that the creator of a container
        is to be considered like an administrator due to the effects they have on
        parts of the operation. Containers MUST be started, stopped, and monitored
        via the management software used.

    title: Secure Use of Containerised IT Systems
    description: In the case of containerised IT systems, consideration MUST be given
        to how containerisation affects the IT systems and applications operated,
        in particular the management and suitability of the applications. Based on
        the protection needs of the applications, it MUST be checked whether the requirements
        for isolation and encapsulation of the containerised IT systems, virtual networks,
        and operated applications are sufficiently fulfilled. The mechanisms of the
        operating system in question SHOULD be included in this check. Since the host
        performs the function of a network component for virtual networks, the modules
        of the sub-layers NET.1 Networks and NET.3 Network Components MUST be considered
        accordingly. Logical and overlay networks MUST also be considered and modelled.
        Furthermore, the containerised IT systems used MUST meet the requirements
        at hand regarding availability and data throughput. During operation, the
        performance and the state of the containerised IT systems SHOULD be monitored
        (health checks).

        included software for security problems, fixes and documents them, and provides
        corresponding guarantees to customers. The utilised version of base images
        MUST NOT be deprecated. Unique version numbers MUST be provided. If an image
        with a newer version number is available, a patch and change management process
        MUST check whether and how it can be rolled out
