        For this requirement, we also check etcd is encrypted, so that secrets, but
        also routes and oauth configurations are secured.


        Concerning Full Disk Encryption:

        Full Disk Encryption can be enabled on OpenShift by installing the cluster
        with FIPS mode enabled.

        OpenShift Container Platform uses certain FIPS Validated / Modules in Process
        modules within RHEL and RHCOS

        for the operating system components that it uses.

        See RHEL7 core crypto components and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/installing/installing-fips.html
        for further information.

        When installing the cluster, The public ssh key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config

        files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added
        to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user

        on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

        The management of the private key is up to the customer.

        LUKS/dm-crypt (used by the FIPS mode) provides full-disk encryption that fulfills
        Req-3.4.1.

        Access to the stored data is only possible via a decryption password that
        must be entered when the disk is mounted (must be somehow

        related to the ssh keypair?...).

        The decryption password is stored using TPM v2, in a secure cryptoprocessor
        contained within a server.

        When enabling FIPS mode, machine configs state that encryption using TPM based
        pinning in clevis is requested for these nodes.'
    title: 3.4.1 If disk encryption is used (rather than file- or column-level database
        encryption), logical access must be managed separately and independently of
        native operating system authentication and access control mechanisms (for
        example, by not using local user account databases or general network login
        credentials). Decryption keys must not be associated with user accounts.
