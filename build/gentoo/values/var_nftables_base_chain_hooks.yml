description: "The possible hooks which can be used to configure the base chain are:\n<tt>ingress</tt>
    (only in netdev family since Linux kernel 4.2, and inet family since Linux kernel
    5.10): \nsees packets immediately after they are passed up from the NIC driver,
    before even prerouting. \n<tt>prerouting</tt> sees all incoming packets, before
    any routing decision has been made. \nPackets may be addressed to the local or
    remote systems.\n<tt>input</tt> sees incoming packets that are addressed to and
    have now been routed \nto the local system and processes running there.\n<tt>forward</tt>
    sees incoming packets that are not addressed to the local system.\n<tt>output</tt>
    sees packets that originated from processes in the local machine.\n<tt>postrouting</tt>
    sees all packets after routing, just before they leave the \nlocal system."
