description: "Base chains are those that are registered into the Netfilter hooks,
    \ni.e. these chains see packets flowing through the Linux TCP/IP stack.\nThe possible
    chain types are:\n<tt>filter</tt>, which is used to filter packets. This is supported
    by \nthe arp, bridge, ip, ip6 and inet table families.\n<tt>route</tt>, which
    is used to reroute packets if any relevant IP \nheader field or the packet mark
    is modified. This chain type provides \nequivalent semantics to the mangle table
    but only for the output hook \n(for other hooks use type filter instead). This
    is supported by the \nip, ip6 and inet table families.\n<tt>nat</tt>, which is
    used to perform Networking Address Translation (NAT). \nOnly the first packet
    of a given flow hits this chain; subsequent packets bypass it. \nThis chain should
    be never used for filtering. The nat chain type \nis supported by the ip, ip6
    and inet table families.\n "
