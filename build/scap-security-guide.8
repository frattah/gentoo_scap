.TH scap-security-guide 8 "26 Jan 2013" "version 1"

.SH NAME
SCAP-Security-Guide \- Delivers security guidance, baselines, and
associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP).


.SH DESCRIPTION
The project provides practical security hardening advice
and also links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment
activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include requirements
in the U.S. government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as well
as of the financial services and health care industries. For example,
high-level and widely-accepted policies such as NIST 800-53 provides prose
stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged user actions," but do
not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges the gap between
generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP
formats to support automation whenever possible.
